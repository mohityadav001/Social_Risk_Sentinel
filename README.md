# Introduction

Social media and online communities provide people with safe and anonymous places to talk about their mental health and share their emotions. To help prevent suicide, it's important to identify posts and messages online that may indicate someone is thinking about suicide. I used advanced technology called natural language processing (NLP) to do this. Specifically, I looked at two popular websites, Reddit and Twitter. By analyzing the words people use in their posts, and using techniques like machine learning and deep learning, I can determine if someone might be at risk of suicide or not.
