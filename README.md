# Introduction

Social media and online communities provide people with safe and anonymous places to talk about their mental health and share their emotions. To help prevent suicide, it's important to identify posts and messages online that may indicate someone is thinking about suicide. I used advanced technology called natural language processing (NLP) to do this. Specifically, I looked at two popular websites, Reddit and Twitter. By analyzing the words people use in their posts, and using techniques like machine learning and deep learning, I can determine if someone might be at risk of suicide or not.

# DataSet

I gathered data from two different sources: Reddit and Twitter. In the Reddit dataset, there were 2958 instances of posts suggesting suicidal thoughts, alongside 5381 posts that did not indicate suicidal intentions. These posts were collected from various subreddits such as 'suicide watch', 'depression', and 'anxiety'. On Twitter, I collected a total of 3000 tweets that contained phrases like 'end my life' or 'die'.
